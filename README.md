# 3D-Renderer (Python)
- this is my first attempt at 3d graphics and eventually shading
- renderer uses a face sorting algorithm rather than a traditional zbuffer for rendering. this will cause faces to clip and render over one another when viewing them at specific angles
## To-do:
- allow shapes to be colored using a colors class with built-in colors and custom ones
- shading (maybe based on distance?, if not then calculate how much of the face is visible and shade accordingly or something of that sort)
- organize/simplify
- create more python files to divide and simplify code. (libraries in a sence)
- render using tris and not quads ðŸ’€
- make it where it doesn't render faces behind you
- constructor for creating shapes easier / clean object class for simplification
- advanced camera movement
- object manager / gui using tkinter
